# About me
esy.sh, Reason, OCaml and Emacs. I  maintain esy, the package manager, and it's ecosystem (native packages, compiler package and tools)

I constantly look marry open source with product development and user value. I primarily use Reason and OCaml. Currently interested in improving tooling productivity and reliability. Esy, in my opinion has the same primary goals as a tool, inspiring me to maintain it.

All my OSS work is sponsored by you folks. If you like my work, consider funding it. If you have additional requests concerning open source work, head over to https://manas-jayanth.com or leave me an email at prometheansacrifice [at] gmail
