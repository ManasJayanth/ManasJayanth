# About me
esy.sh, Reason, OCaml and Emacs. I  maintain esy, the package manager, and it's ecosystem (native packages, compiler package and tools)

I constantly look marry open source with product development and user value. I primarily use Reason and OCaml. Currently interested in improving tooling productivity and reliability. Esy, in my opinion has the same primary goals as a tool, inspiring me to maintain it.

Any work I do on open source is sponsored by you folks. If you like my work, consider funding it. If you have additional requests concerning open source work, head over to https://manas-jayanth.com or leave me an email at prometheansacrifice [at] gmail
